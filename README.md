<h1>GIKI Ride Booking App</h1>

<p>This project is a Flutter-based ride booking application designed specifically for students at the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKI). The app facilitates booking rides within the university campus for students, enhancing convenience and mobility.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ride Booking</strong>: Users can book rides within the GIKI campus using the app, allowing for quick and easy transportation between locations.</li>
  <li><strong>MySQL and PHP Backend</strong>: Utilizes MySQL database and PHP backend for data storage and management, ensuring reliability and scalability of the application.</li>
  <li><strong>Flutter Dart Frontend</strong>: Developed using Flutter's Dart language for building native mobile applications, providing a smooth and responsive user interface.</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase Authentication and Authorization</strong>: Implements Firebase authentication and authorization for secure user login and access control, ensuring data privacy and security.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>User Authentication</strong>: Users log in to the app using their GIKI credentials, which are authenticated securely using Firebase authentication.</li>
  <li><strong>Ride Booking</strong>: Upon successful login, users can book rides by selecting their pickup and drop-off locations within the GIKI campus.</li>
  <li><strong>Database Integration</strong>: The app communicates with the MySQL database through a PHP backend to fetch ride information and store booking details.</li>
  <li><strong>Booking Confirmation</strong>: Once a ride is booked, users receive a confirmation notification and can track the status of their ride within the app.</li>
</ol>
